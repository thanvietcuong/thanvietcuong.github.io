I am a Master Student in University of Nebraska, Lincoln. My interest is Theoretical Computer Science in general. I have been doing research on graph algorithms for 4 years. I am currently working under the advise of Dr. Deogun. I am fortunate to archieve high prizes in both Mathematics and Competitive Programming Olympiads. I will complete my Master next semester. After graduation, I will continue my academic career as a Ph.D. candidate.
