I am a Master Student at University of Nebraska, Lincoln. My interest is Theoretical Computer Science in general. I was fortunate to archieve high prizes in both Mathematics and Competitive Programming Olympiads. I am currently working under the advise of Dr. Deogun and will complete my Master next semester. My interested topic is graph algorithms. I am applying for a Ph.D position in Fall 2021. If you have any question about my information, please contact me via email: cthan2@huskers.unl.edu.
