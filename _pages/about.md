I am a Master Student at University of Nebraska, Lincoln. I am currently working under the advise of Dr. Deogun and will complete my Master next semester. My interest is Theoretical Computer Science in general and graph algorithms in particular.

I am applying for a Ph.D position in Fall 2021. My priority is to continue studying theory of Computer Science and its open problems. If you have any question about my information, please contact me via email: cthan2@huskers.unl.edu.
