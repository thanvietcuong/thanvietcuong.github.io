Many optimization problems such as Maximum Independent Set, Maximum Clique,
Minimum Clique Cover and Maximum Induced Matching are NP-hard on general graphs. However, they could be solved in polynomial time when restricted to some particular graph classes
such as comparability and co-comparability graph classes. In this paper, we summarize the latest algorithms solving some classical NP-hard problems on some graph classes over the years.
Moreover, we apply the -redundant technique to obtain linear time O(j j) algorithms which
find a Maximum Induced Matching on interval and circular-arc graphs. Inspired of these results,
we have proposed some competitive programming problems for some programming contests in
Vietnam in recent years
